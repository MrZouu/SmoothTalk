Sign language interpreter, to switch from a video signal to a corresponding word.
This machine-learning project, powered by TensorFlow, aims to develop a sign language recognition system.

⚠️This project is the result of a common work, made for school with a deadline and is still under development

#  Google Colab
For this project, Google colab is a very useful tool for processing our data in our machine learning pipeline.  
In fact, Colab includes a gpu, enabling us to process our data more quickly and simply.  
- ## Usage
* **Import code** (jupyter file) into colab
* **Upload a dataset in zip format to the Google Drive** - associated with the google account used on Colab.
* **Change path in code and log in**
* **Respect the tree structure**
